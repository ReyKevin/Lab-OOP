# 8 Puzzle (Object Oriented Programming)

This project was created as a requirement to fulfill Object Oriented Programming's final project in the 4th semester and written in Java. It was done by my team, consists of Julio, Moes, Arda, and I. For this project we decided to try implementing the application of simple Artificial Intelligence known as Breadth First Search. The program will be able to generate random number sequence and solve the puzzle. The random number sequence generated will by solved by the program by using Breadth First Search method. The program will run until the random number sequence matched the desired sequence that has been determined in the program. This program will display the generated random number sequence and the solving method until the sequence matched the desired sequence.
